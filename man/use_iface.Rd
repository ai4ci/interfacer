\description{
Generating and documenting an \code{iface} for a given dataframe would be time
consuming and annoying if you can't do it automatically. In this case as you
interactively develop a package any given dataframe's structure can be
explicitly documented and made into a specific contract within the package.
By default all the interface contracts are named and
